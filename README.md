# mindref
webapi for mindgames image server


Initially based on examples from [eve-demo](https://github.com/pyeve/eve-demo) and [mriqc's web api](https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqcwebapi).

Currently super bare bones.

Start it up as follows:

```
cd docker-ever
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Browse to localhost for the swagger api documentation.
